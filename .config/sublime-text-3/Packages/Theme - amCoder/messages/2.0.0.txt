amCoder has been updated!


What's New
==========

!!!BREAK CHANGES!!!

YOUR SUBLIME MAY LOOKS WIRED RIGHT NOW BUT PLEASE READ ON.

The "amCoder Gray" theme, "Monokai Low-Profile" and "Monokai Low-Profile Gray" color-schemes have been removed.

Instead, the "amCoder" theme and color-scheme have been rebuilt for better visibility.

Try modifying your user preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User` (âŒ˜+, on Mac).

*Note: Don't forget to restart Sublime Text after changing the theme.*


Theme Settings
--------------

{
  "theme": "amCoder.sublime-theme"
}

Color-Scheme
------------

amCoder looks best with this modified version of Monokai:

{
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - amCoder/amCoder.tmTheme"
}


*Note: Don't forget to restart Sublime Text after changing the theme.*
